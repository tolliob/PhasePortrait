__**Files:**__

* Color:                Module to convert Riemann Sphere complex numbers to
                        a color using the HLS model or the RGB model

* RiemmannSphere:       Module to define the Riemann Sphere complex numbers

* PhasePortrait:        Module to draw phase portrait of function defined
                        in a part of the complex plane, and valued in the
                        complex plane

* PhasePortraitWidgets: Define an interactive Jupyter widge to draw phase portraits
                        of function defined in a part of the complex plane, and valued
                        in the complex plane

* SpecialFunctions:     Module to define special functions defined in a part of
                        the complex plane, and valued in the complex plane
